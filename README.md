# RescueRobotGA

Study of the problem of searching for the disequilibrium situations in the example case of RescueRobot, using two different critera (fitness functions). 

All implementations use `MBT-module` and `mdp_simulator_launcher` by Matteo Camilli to compute the fitness functions of the genetic algorithms.

The used libraries for the genetic algorithms are `JMetal` `JMetalPy` `Pymoo`.
