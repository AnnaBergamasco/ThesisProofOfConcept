# Thesis Proof of Concept

Study of the problem of searching for the disequilibrium situations for cyber-physical systems, applied to two examples: RescueRobot and UAVS.

All implementations use `MBT-module` and `mdp_simulator_launcher` by Matteo Camilli to compute the fitness functions of the genetic algorithms.

The used libraries for the genetic algorithms are `JMetal` `JMetalPy` `Pymoo`.

## Installation

To run the code simply clone the repository form this GitHub page and follow the dedicated instructions for each implementation. 

All the implementations need:
* `MBT-module` it can be downloaded from its GitHub page [https://github.com/SELab-unimi](https://github.com/) mbt-module and installed following the provided instructions.
* `Python3`
